I then proceeded to delete the first 2 columns in order to use the new 'ClaimID' as the new unique identifier.\n    \n![image](image.png)\n\n\n\n-Time to Close\n\nThe time to close data point associated with the ClaimID 2019.0079 was '-57' which has been changed to '57'as the number of days that it takes for the claim to close needs to be an absolute value to match the criteria.\n    \n    \n-Claim Amount\n\nTo remove the currency symbol from the 'Claim Amount' column, the 'Replace' formula was used again to remove the first 2 characters from each string. \nTo remove the punctuation on the Claim Amount, the 'Find and Replace' function was used to remove the commas within the integer and replace them with nothing, which had the same effect as deleting it.This also removed the full stops used for decimal placements in the column\n\n![image-2](image-2.png)\n    \n-Amount Paid\n\nThe 'Amount Paid' column followed the character criteria and required no changes/modifications.\n\n-Location\n\nThe 'Location' column followed the character criteria and required no changes/modifications.\n\n-Individuals on Claim\n\nThe 'Individuals On Claim' column followed the character criteria and required no changes/modifications.\n\n-Linked Cases\n\nThe 'Linked Cases' column followed the character criteria and required no changes/modifications.\n\n-Cause\n\nTo replace the empty cells with 'unknown', the replace tool was used again to modify the data points in the 'Cause' column to fit the criteria.\n\nA picture of a section of the updated data set has been attached below in order to show the updated cells.\n\n![image-3](image-3.png)\n\n\n\t","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"181219ce-3baa-4b86-bb64-7f8d609e4722"},{"source":"# Data Discovery & Visualisation\n# \n\n-How does the number of claims differ across locations?\n\n![image-4](image-4.png)\n\nThere are 4 locations within the data set where claims where made. Sao Luis is the location with the highest number of claims(30), Recife with 25, Fortaleza with 22 and Natal has the lowest number of claims with 21. This gives a total of 98 claims against Vivendo.\n\n-What is the distribution of time to close claims?\n![image-10](image-10.png)\n\nThe histogram above shows that most of the cases were closed under 2400 days, with 2 outliers at 2997 and 3591 days. The most common ranges for cases to close where 200-400 days and 400-600 days with 16 cases each. This could possibly suggest that the legal team should aim to close future cases between 200-600 days.\n\n-How does the average time to close claims differ by location?\n\n![image-11](image-11.png)\n\nThe boxplots above display the distribution of the closing times per location with a line across them portraying the city's average.  Sao Luis has the highest average closing time at 1030 days and also has the highest IQR of 1405, which contributes to the fact Sao Luis doesn't have outliers. The other cities have 2-3 outliers with averages between 580-860 days. Their IQRs range between 440-590 suggesting Sao Luis has the most inconsistent data which in turn implies that the legal team should focus more on cases in Sao Luis. Further analysis should be carried using cases from Sao Luis in order to determine if there are significant patterns that are yet to be addressed.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8cf304a2-8acc-4280-a8d9-5dacf87c8d48"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
